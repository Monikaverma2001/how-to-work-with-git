Git is a version control system.
Git helps you keep track of code changes.
Git is used to collaborate on code.

branching: In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update the design on it.
With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch
EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!
Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix
Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch
You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there
Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)

$git branch branchname

$git checkout hello-world-images
Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'

create+switch branch on same time:
$git checkout -b branchname

merge branch
$git merge branchname

merge and after merge delete branch no longer needed:
$git branch -d branchname
